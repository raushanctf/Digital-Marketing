# 📢 Google Ads – Explained
* Google Ads is Google’s online advertising platform that allows businesses to display ads on Google Search, YouTube, and across the Google Display Network. It works mainly on a PPC (Pay-Per-Click) model.

💡 What is PPC (Pay-Per-Click)?
* In PPC advertising, you pay only when someone clicks on your ad. It’s a way of buying visits to your website, rather than earning them organically.

✅ **How Google Ads PPC Works**
👉 Choose Keywords:
* You select keywords that people might search for (e.g., “buy sweets online”).

1. Create Ads:
* Write a headline, description, and add a link to your landing page.

2. Bid on Keywords:
* You set a maximum bid you're willing to pay per click.

3. Ad Auction:
* When someone searches, Google runs an auction and decides which ads to show based on:
* Your bid
* Your ad quality score
* Relevance and landing page experience

5. Pay Only for Clicks:
* You’re only charged when someone clicks on your ad, not for impressions.

**🔍 Types of Google Ads Campaigns**
* **Search Ads:**	Google Search results (text ads), Leads, traffic, sales
* **Display Ads:** Banner ads on websites/apps, Brand awareness, retargeting
* **Video Ads:** YouTube	Brand engagement, storytelling
* **Shopping Ads:**	Google Shopping (product listings), E-commerce, and product-based businesses
* **App Promotion Ads:**	Search, YouTube, Display, Driving app installs
* **Performance Max:** All Google channels (auto-optimized)	All-in-one campaigns

**🔧 Tools to Use with Google Ads**
* Google Keyword Planner (find keywords)
* Google Analytics (track results)
* Google Tag Manager (manage tags/conversions)
* Google Merchant Center (for Shopping ads)

**💰 Bidding System in Google Ads**
* The Google Ads bidding system determines how much you pay for clicks, impressions, or conversions. You set bids to tell Google how much you’re willing to pay for a desired action (click, conversion, etc.).

**Google then uses this information during the ad auction to decide:**
* Whether your ad will show
* In which position
* And at what cost

* CPM Model: (Cost per mile and thousand impressions): The amount you pay for 1,000 ad impressions (views).
* CPC Model: (Cost per click): You set maximum bids yourself for each keyword.
* CPA Model:- (Cost per Acquisition or action): Google sets bids to get as many conversions as possible at your target cost per action.
* CPV Model: (Cost per view): The amount you pay each time someone views your video ad.
* CPI Model: (cost per installation): The amount you pay when a user installs your mobile app after clicking your ad.

# 🧱 Structure of Google Ads (Hierarchical Format)**
* Google Ads is organized in three main levels:

1. 🔲 **Account**
* This is your overall Google Ads account.
* Linked to your email, billing, and business settings.
* Each advertiser has one or more ad accounts.

2. 📂 **Campaigns**
* A campaign contains one or more ad groups.
* You define:
* Goal (e.g., sales, leads, traffic)
* Budget
* Bidding strategy
* Network (Search, Display, YouTube, Shopping)
* Location targeting
* Start/end dates
* Ad scheduling

3. 🗂️ **Ad Groups**
* Each campaign has one or more ad groups.
* An ad group:
   * Groups related keywords
   * Shows specific ads based on those keywords
* You define the target keywords and match types.
* Example: In a campaign for sweets, you may have:
   * Ad Group 1: "Diwali Sweets" → Keywords like diwali mithai, buy festive sweets

4. 📢 **Ads**
* The actual ads that appear to users (text, image, or video).
* Each ad includes:
   * Headline
   * Description
   * Display URL
   * Final URL (landing page)
   * Optional: Sitelinks, Callouts, Structured Snippets
     
5. 🔑 **Keywords (for Search Campaigns)**

* Use match types:
   * Broad Match (buy sweets online)
   * Phrase Match ("buy sweets online")
   * Exact Match ([buy sweets online])

* AD Extension:- Ad extensions are additional pieces of information that expand your search ads. They give users more reasons to click and improve your ad's performance, without extra cost per click.

**Different Types of Extensions**
